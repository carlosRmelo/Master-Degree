This model is the simplest model possible (with inclusion of dark matter).
Here we include a dark matter component and a external shear to gravitational lensing.

Then, in this model we have a total of 9 free parameters:
	- One mass-to-light ratio
	- One beta (anisotropy) 
	- Inclination
	- Black hole mass 
	- Dark matter intensity
	- Dark matter axial ratio
	- Shear intensity 
	- Shear angle
	- Gamma
