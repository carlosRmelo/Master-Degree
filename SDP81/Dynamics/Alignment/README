We want to align the images from HST and MUSE, because we note a slight offset between it.
Also, because Jampy assumes that the galaxy has its semi major axis along the x-axis, we rotate the aligned images by the PA angle to acomplish this requirement of Jampy.

To align the HST image and Muse, first we cut and resample the HST image (hst_12194_01_wfc3_ir_f160w_drz.fits) to same the same resolution and field of view of Muse image (Muse.fits). This let us with a new image of HST (hst_cut.fits).
After that, we use the astroalign package to align the images. Due the higher resolution, we use the HST as a reference. So, the final Muse aligned image is save as Muse_aligned.fits.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, once we have the images already aligned we want to rotate them in such a way that the major semi-axis is on the x-axis. This is made by a rotation by the PA angle, finded by find_my_galaxy during the HST data reduction and MGE parametrization (See folder HST Data Reduction).
In this step, we have the HST emission arcs, so we rotate it too.
All the products are storage in Rotate folder.

Some informations:

PA: 		11.6 [deg]
HST arcs:	arcs_wcs.fits

We also plot the contours overlaid. But this is done in Plot contour folder.
