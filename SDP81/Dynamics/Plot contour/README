Overlap ALMA, MUSE (Vrms Map) and HST data.

This is done in two different "regimes". One with the data in its original position, and other with the images rotated by the PA angle. The second plot is done just to verify if the rotation is OK.

It is import to note that the images here are alredy aligned and with correct WCS (in tha ALMA case).
