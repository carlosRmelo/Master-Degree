We simulate a Vrms map using for that:

- A elliptical NFW profile
- Stellar Component

With this same mass components, we simulate a lens galaxy:
- MGE elliptical mass profile
- MGE stellar mass
- External Shear

We simulate a source galaxy, using a Sersic profile and then, using the lens galaxy we obtein the gravitational arcs.


All this simulation data will be used as imput for the Emcee, where we try to recory it.
An import note: For the Emcee, we will use an pseudo Elliptical NFW model, not the MGE decomposition.
This could give us a tip.
