This test is based on jam_axi_rms_example.py by Cappellari.

The goal here is use the MGE decomposition present in the above cited example for the mass profile of a lens galaxy. Then, using this mass profile generate arcs using the deflection angle of MGE parametrization.


After we create a mask around the arcs.
Finally we recovery the source using the original input values.
