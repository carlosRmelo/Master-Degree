Same as Test_2, but build with python Classes to improve MPI execution.


This test is based on jam_axi_rms_example.py by Cappellari.

The objective is to use the simulated data (folder Test_1) and try to recover the initial parameters with Emcee.

The parameters in this case involve both the lens model and the dynamic model. The parameters are:
Mass to light ratio, anisotropy, inclination, external shear, mass of black hole and gamma.
