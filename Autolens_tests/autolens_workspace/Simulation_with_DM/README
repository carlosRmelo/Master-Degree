here we simulate a velocity profile (for Jumpy) and a galaxy+arcs (for auto lens).

In this example we include a dark matter component, represented by a pseudo-NFW profile. 

				__This simulation is based on SDP.81 MGE decomposition.__
				
After simulations, we rebuild all models to test our class CombinedModel.py.
This is archived in __Rebuilding__ folder.
