We do exactly the same as __Rebuilding__ and __Simulation__ folders, but using a new kind of pseudo-NFW (NFW) parametrization.

So, in principle, we should find the same results with a minimal differences.

This new parametrization are described in .../GitHub/Master-Degree/pseudo-NFW.
As we had used data from SDP.81 previously, we do so now as well.



And it works very well! 
							And faster  !!!!!!!!!!
