In this test we implement a emcee to search the parameters of a simulated Vrms map.
In the folder _Simulation_ we genered this data.
And in the folder _Emcee_ we try to find the input values.

We left as a free parameter:
mass-to-light ratio, inclination, mass of black hole and beta (one for all gaussians).
